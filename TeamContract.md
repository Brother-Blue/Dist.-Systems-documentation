<h2>Team Contract:</h2> 
<li><strong>Expectations:</strong><br> First and foremost, our expectations depend on the group members being attentive and hard working throughout the project. The working morale and dedication in the group is quite high, and because of this it is crucial that members of the group keep up with the task they are assigned, to avoid conflict.

Furthermore, we expect that the group members will stay updated on what the other members in the group are doing. This is both to know what they are doing - for when it is their turn to enter the role - as well as being able to contribute and help should it be necessary.

The group members are expected to keep Trello, slack, GitHub and the documentation updated, and inform if anything is drifting away from the plan.

We expect the group members to take part in conversations and meetings on the project, and if such participation will not be possible on any given occasion, the group member will inform of this immediately.

Finally, the quality of work should be that of the singular group members highest capacity. This is to ensure that:
* i) the work one is doing is as good as possible in quality.
* ii) one sees the size of the group not as an opportunity to do less work, but rather as an opportunity to develop their respective skills and deepen their understanding.
* iii) every person in the group has the ability to be challenged and grow intellectually.
* iiii) one evens out a set of boundaries for those with less capacity in the group, making sure that the focus is on an individuals best rather than a set standard. <br>

The group will meet on Mondays and Fridays at 13:00 in Zoom, until the meeting has been concluded. With the need of additional meetings, these will be provided in the same environment as mentioned previously.

<strong>Policies and Procedures:</strong>
Behave in a mature manner. This describes proper meeting etiquette, as well as general respect and professionalism within the working environment.
Be open to help each other. If an issue with understanding occurs, it is fundamental to the group's progression that there is an open environment that allows for aid to be represented to the member(s) who are struggling with a specific topic.
If you do not understand what to do, ask for assistance. Your group members are there to assist you, if you need it.
Do not intentionally sabotage for other group members.
Keep yourself up to date with others' work. If something new is added to the code, for instance a commit or a push, ensure that you are up to date with its functionality.
Each and everyone in the team has a responsibility to carry out their tasks and gather necessary knowledge to succeed in these tasks. If something should hinder this, it must be communicated in a timely manner in order to assess the impact and give the team an opportunity to address these issues.

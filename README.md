## Purpose <a name="purpose"></a>
### What are you going to make? <a name="what"></a>
We will build a web-application that allows citizens of Gothenburg to book dentist appointments. 
The application will display a map that the user can navigate and find dentist offices.
In the application the user can choose among different dentist offices to book appointments at. 

### Why will you make it? <a name="why"></a>
There is a real demand for this kind of system and as of now there is no available system that 
provides users the opportunity to select from various dentist offices in their area.

### How are you going to make it? <a name="how"></a>
We will build a distributed web-application powered by Node.js and Express using the MQTT-protocol.
